# Puzzles Overview

<Description children="A CTF protocol, where players create and solve EVM puzzles to earn NFTs." />

## Introduction

A puzzle becomes available to solve by anyone as soon as an author adds it to the [Curta contract](/docs/contracts#curta-puzzles). When a player submits a valid solution, a [Flag](/docs/puzzles/submitting-solutions#flag-nfts) NFT is minted to the solver, and they earn [points](/docs/leaderboard), which are used to place them on the [leaderboard](/leaderboard).

## Submission period

Immediately after a puzzle is added, the puzzle enters **Phase 0**, the period where nobody has solved the puzzle yet. Then, as players solve the puzzle, it progresses through 4 Phases:

Simply put, each puzzle's submission period lasts from the time it's added until 5 days after the first valid solution is submitted (aka **First Blood**).

## Generative puzzles

<Callout>
  Every puzzle must implement a `generate(address)` function, which takes in the
  user's address as a seed and returns a unique starting position. This way,
  each puzzle is _generative_, and each solution is unique to the solver.
</Callout>

Since the protocol is 100% onchain, every submission is public. The generative aspect prevents front-running and allows for multiple winners: even if you see someone else's solution, you still have to figure out what the rules/constraints of the puzzle are and solve it from _your_ starting position.

To put it more rigorously, the [`solve` function](https://github.com/waterfall-mkt/curta/blob/2d5de33e3e08ff478ad9e33b6a6f00f819224122/src/Curta.sol#L107) on [Curta](/docs/contracts#curta-puzzles) requires the following to return `true`:

```sol showLineNumbers={false}
puzzle.verify(
    puzzle.generate(msg.sender), // Unique starting position, seeded by the address of the solver.
    _solution
)
```
