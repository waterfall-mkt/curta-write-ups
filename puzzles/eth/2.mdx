## Overview

There are 2 steps to the puzzle:

1. Write a contract that implments `ISolve` and returns the address of [Curta](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000006bC8D9e5e9d436217B88De704a9F307) when `curtaPlayer` is called.
2. Deploy the contract to a _vanity address_ prefixed with specific bytes, then submit the address as the solution.

```sol fileName="Solve.sol"
contract Solve is ISolve {
    function curtaPlayer() external view returns (address) {
        return 0x0000000006bC8D9e5e9d436217B88De704a9F307;
    }
}
```

## Computing the address

<Callout>
  For more information on vanity addresses and how to mine for them, see [this
  article](https://0xfoobar.substack.com/p/vanity-addresses).
</Callout>

If you submitted before the timestamp `1678446000` (March 10, 2023 11 AM; roughly 2 days after the puzzle was added), the prefix you had to mine for changed every 256 blocks (roughly every 51 minutes):

- The first 2 bytes had to be `0xF1A9`.
- The next 2 bytes were picked from the submitting address based on the block number at submission.

<Callout intent="neutral">
  If you submitted before the timestamp, you had a time constraint to compute, mine, and execute the
  entire solution in 256 blocks.
</Callout>

If you submitted after the timestamp, there was no time constraint, andÂ you just had to mine for a contract with 4 `0` bytes.
